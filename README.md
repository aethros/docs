# GWU Advanced OS Book

Find most class information in the [github org](https://github.com/gwu-cs-advos/organization).
This book is GPL v2 licensed, so if you distribute this book, you must make your updates public.
Further, if you make updates to the book, make that clear in the `c09_contributors.md`.
This is necessary for two reasons:

1. Gabe doesn't want your brilliant changes attributed to him, and
2. you should have attribution for your updates!

Please do PRs to fix up the text and add to it!
Add yourself to the contributors when you do.

Build the book:

1. Install `pandoc`and `latex` (e.g. `apt-get install pandoc texlive texlive-latex-extra`),
2. `./build.sh`

I have no idea if this will work on non-Linux systems.
